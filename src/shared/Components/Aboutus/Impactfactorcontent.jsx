                    Our organisation gives full importance to publishing high-quality manuscripts. Our journals are indexed in top-class organizations around the world and strive to achieve high citation rates due to open-access publications. The Impact Factor shows the average number of citations received by a particular paper of the journal during a defined period. As authors know, the impact factor is given to journals after a few years of starting, and we do all efforts to get a high impact factor. We will shortly upload our citation and quality report.

                    The impact factor (IF) is a measure of the frequency with which the average article in a journal has been cited in a particular year. It is used to measure the importance or rank of a journal by calculating the times its articles are cited.

                    The calculation is based on a two-year period and involves dividing the number of times articles were cited by the number of articles that are citable.
