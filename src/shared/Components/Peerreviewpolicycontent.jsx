        The review process is an important aspect of the publication process of an article. It helps an editor in making decision on an article and also enables the author to improve the manuscript. Academic Journals operates a double blind review process.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Author(s) identity is removed from the manuscript and shielded from the reviewers during the review process. The reviewer is left with only the manuscript without any information that might enable him/her to uncover the identity of the author(s). Information removed includes the author(s) name, address/affiliation, country, phone/fax, and email. Any information in the Acknowledgement and Declaration of Conflict of Interest that may lead to uncovering the identity of the author is also removed from the manuscript prior to sending it to reviewers.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
